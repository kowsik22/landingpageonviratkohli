                 <!-- <p>An icon in Indian cricket, one of the best batters to ever play the sport, a man who brought a paradigm shift in Indian cricket with his approach towards the game.  From being a chubby cricketer known for his love for Delhi street food, Kohli has become a gluten-free athlete who has climbed up the ladder of success in the sport through nothing else but his sheer grit and determination to succeed.

                    While Kohli remains one of India's favourite cricketing sons, his charisma goes beyond the nation's boundaries. The Indian cricket team skipper has fans all over the world. Some of the greats of the game have often fallen short of words while praising Kohli's passion for the game.</p>
